#Channels
Channels are a tool for broadcasting your messages to large audiences.

#Supergroups
Supergroups are a powerful tool for building communities and can support up to 200,000 members each.
Technically, supergroups are actually channels: they are represented by channel constructors, with the megagroup flag set to true.

#Forums
Supergroups can be converted into forums, splitting conversion into distinct forum topics, see the forum documentation for more info ».

#Gigagroups
Gigagroups are something between a channel and a supergroup.
